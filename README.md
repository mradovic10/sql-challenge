Module 9 Challenge

This repository contains an EmployeeSQL folder that includes:

- a PNG file of the Entity Relationship Diagram titled "data_modeling_ERD".

- a SQL file of table schemata titled "data_engineering";

- a SQL file of necessary queries titled "data_analysis".


The database contains six tables: "departments", "titles", "employees", "salaries", "dept_emp", and "dept_manager". Data was imported from CSV files into the tables using the pgAdmin 4 "Import/Export Data..." option.

In the "data_analysis" file, eight various queries were created. Each one is preceded by its description.
